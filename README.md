# BARK Token Program

## 1. Overview

The BARK Token Program is a Solana-based token system designed to facilitate the creation, transfer, and management of a digital asset named "BARK" on the Solana blockchain. Leveraging the Solana web3.js library, the program enables seamless interactions with the Solana blockchain.

## What are Token Extensions?

"Token Extensions (also known as Token-2022) are an advanced token program on the Solana blockchain, extending the capabilities of the existing Token Program. It's designed to offer developers enhanced flexibility and additional functionalities without compromising the safety of current tokens."

"This program encompasses all features of its predecessor (it maintains compatibility with the original Token instruction and account layouts) while providing new instructions and functionality. These extensions introduce new fields in mints and accounts."

## 2. Architecture

The program is structured with modular components, utilizing Solana's SPL 2022 Token Standard and SPL Token Metadata programs. Key components include:

- **Solana Token 2022 Program (SPL):**
  - Manages the creation, transfer, and minting of BARK.
  - Implements a transfer fee mechanism for each token transfer.

- **Token Metadata Program:**
  - Manages metadata associated with BARK, including name, symbol, website, and social media links.
  - Enables the creation and updating of metadata for BARK.

- **Bark Token Program:**
  - Coordinates interactions between the SPL 2022 Token Standard and Token Metadata programs.
  - Implements additional features specific to the BARK token, such as fee harvesting.

## 3. Functions and Features

### Create Mint Account

- Check if the Mint account for BARK tokens exists; if not, create a new one.
- Initializes the Mint with transfer fee configuration.

### Create BARK Token Account

- Creates a new BARK token account associated with a specific owner's public key.

### BARK Transfer with Fee

- Performs a BARK token transfer with a dynamic transfer fee based on a percentage of the transfer amount.

### Withdraw Withheld BARK from Token Accounts

- Withdraws withheld BARK tokens from accounts with non-zero fees.

### Perform BARK Mint

- Mints new BARK tokens into a specified account.

### Harvest Withheld Fees to Mint Account

- Collects withheld fees from BARK token accounts and deposits them into the Mint account.

### Withdraw Fees from Mint BARK Account

- Fees (or taxes) associated with transferring BARK tokens. Withdraw fees collected in the Mint account.

### Check Wallet Balance

- Retrieves and displays the balance of the wallet in SOL or BARK.

### Check BARK Token Balances

- Retrieves and displays the balances of BARK token accounts associated with the wallet.

### Create or Get Fee Account

- Check if a fee account exists; if not, create a new fee account.

### Harvest Withheld Fees to Fee Account

- Transfers withheld fees to the fee (Treasury) account.

### Distribute BARK to Multiple Accounts

- Distributes a specified amount of BARK tokens to multiple accounts.

## 6. How It Works ?

The Bark Token Program follows a step-by-step workflow:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Mint account creation and initialization.
   - Setup of wallet and keypairs.

2. **BARK Token Operations:**
   - BARK token transfers with dynamic transfer fees.
   - Minting new BARK tokens.
   - Withdrawal of withheld fees.

3. **Metadata Management:**
   - Creation and updating of metadata associated with the BARK token.

4. **Fee Handling:**
   - Harvesting withheld fees from token accounts to the Mint account.
   - Withdrawal of fees from the Mint account.
   - Distribution of fees to a designated fee account.

5. **Balance Checking:**
   - Checking the balance of the wallet and BARK token accounts.

6. **Advanced Features:**
   - Distribution of BARK tokens to multiple accounts.
